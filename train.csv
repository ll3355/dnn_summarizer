still shocked even put dvd who would waste money thing though might imagine extras bonus footage dvd fact theres even menu movie starts playingfirst writer movie deserves tortured killed one worst scripts ever written plagued terrible oneliners remarkably unbelievable fake dialogue inappropriate comments like lees comment lundgrens err manhood ill mention later one single sincere sounding line entire movie dialogue plot go handinhand script plot progress entirely nonsensical fashion two cops hate apparent reason beginning reason all lees character pulls side road runs around side car says im going let go alone cause despite myself like you want see get killed  something extent anyhow disgusting oneliners mostly said lee instance duking bad guy lee says you right remain silent  right dead lastly ill mention entirely inappropriate nonsensical comment lee makes lundgrens netherregions bad guys start attack seemingly random love scene lundgren carrere lundgren decides fight underwear lee says him incase die wanted let know biggest dick ive ever seen guy  yes actually says that makes sense even possible lee never actually sees lundgren naked would know writer threw script anyway entire movie looks like kind action video game lee even admits it lee underwearonly lundgren defeat bad guys lee makes comment also truly beautiful wow sort like video game defeated first wavesecond plot movie despicable suffers opinion mainly fact exist trailer movie  imdb available viewing way  makes sound like movie two cops trying stop japanese yakuza taking lost angeles extremely misleading however since movie practically nothing all make brief vague references yakuza trying start methamphetamine business local drug dealers entire movie actually revolves around poorlywritten attempt kenner lundgrens character revenge death parents yakuza leader named yoshida killed  years old entire plot basically summed like this yoshida wants kenner dead kenner wants yoshida dead two try two kill other course kenners sarcastic sidekick named johnny played brandon lee acts like ignorant idiot tia carrere gets naked twicethe acting one worst parts entire movie dialogue unrealistic entirely insincere portrayal emphasizes even more expect poor acting action stars anyway movie highlights unimaginably bad acting ever recordedfinally get heart movies baseness flagrantly bad action many astoundingly bad unrealistic action sequences movie downright impressive managed fit in although lee fair share bad scenes well truly terrible action involves lundgren instance lundgren nonchalantly takes four five kung fu bad guys onehanded without spilling tea then surprised oncoming speeding car lundgren casually leaps it reaches closed door grabs villain side pulls back door beats up picks tia carrere gently walks not runs backward glass door shatters around him leaps onestory height tia still arm lift entire car without slightest effort uses barricade shield bullets shameless gunfights terrible well lundgren lee killing every bad guy instantaneously rain bullets fifty attackers never seem hit either them is course final fight scene movie lundgren gets shot point blank bare chest region even manage miss heart would still immediately begin fill lungs blood kill within matter seconds despite this lundgren remains topnotch condition manages duke middle parade yoshida evil super villain course passing people parade dressed samurai carrying real fully sharpened katanas two use sword fight addition bullet wound lundgren gets several deep slices chest arms stop him no course not fact seconds later easily killing evil yoshida who gets pinned dartboardlike wheel bursts flames reason lundgren casually walks tia lee injured all god terribleall factors mixed entirely unnecessary gratuitous nude scene every five minutes including topless women party beheading topless woman women strip club nude women japanese spa pointless hot tub love scene tia mention trip bizarre sushi bar rich japanese men eating sushi naked women which way prompts lee say much fake enthusiasm defeating bad guys lundgren go eat fish naked chicks which course followed disturbing high five cant forget terrible editing either like villains crushing man trapped car junk yard editors left really obvious glimpse prop dummy credits also list enormous list stunt workers implies lot action probably done movie stars allin end movie repeatedly outdoes self brazen badness illogical impossible result remarkably entertaining looking kind thoughtful cinema movie make want die looking good laugh good time

dream also represent feelings guilt murder dianes sense unfulfillment regarding unachieved goals lifea rather long hilarious scene one involving hitman diane apparently sees major force behind campaign trying pressure director accept camillas part movie from adams party second half movie therefore occupies major part dream feelings guilt remorse towards murder camilla part wants miss turns

movie recently released dvd us finally got chance see hardtofind gem even came original theatrical previews italian horror classics like spasmo beyond darkness unfortunately previews best thing moviezombi  bizarre way actually linked infamous lucio fulci zombie franchise began  similarly compared zombie zombi  consists threadbare plot handful extremely bad actors keeps horror trash barely afloat gore nearly nonexistent unless one frightened people running around green moss faces english dubbing notch embarrassingthe plot time around involves sort covert military operation bunch inept scientists ie idiotic male stupid female sidekick developing sort chemical called death one supposed reanimate dead unless ears need checked even recall reason research death one seems exist wreak havoc upon poor souls made mistake choosing star cinematic laughfestanyway death one experimented corpse whom swear looked like yul brynner injected system sits upright head explodes sound effects also quite hilarious  corpses face bubbles green slime sound paper crumpling heard death one toxin transported outside hijacked group thieves one makes it infects cutting exposed vialneedless say guy turns zombie makes timely escape cheap motel infects lowly porter murders maid pushing face bathroom mirror military catch wind immediately take action eliminating everyone unlucky enough within contamination zone turn motel upside down find infected thief burn body smoke infect flock birds flying chimney stackwe cut introduction group men leave army listening groovy music coming little dinky boombox trailing trailerload slutty girls leaning windows showing chests someone say zombie food also subplot involving girl boyfriend driving car stop inspect group birds lying road birds infected zombie smoke birds attack boyfriend girl drives deserted gas station seek water one incredibly hilarious moments movie walks around old dirty rusty obviously abandoned building continues ask aloud hello anyone here please need water encounters group zombies one chained wall  swinging machete bit rumbling tumbling around ground escapes blowing gas station lightermeanwhile birds attack trailerload whores one girl gets pecked infected pull motel original infection took place second hilarious moment film takes place matter hours a day most motel caked dust vines growing throughout it looks like sitting derelict years anyway better place take refuge particular building needless say group begins break several people walk together get stuck incredibly stupid situation involving zombie attackthe third hilarious moment concerns man woman explore deserted village woman comments this place dump proceeds get pushed balcony zombie pirahna infested water legs bitten turns zombie within seconds meanwhile friend back motel got pecked infected hours earlier still turning zombieunfortunately many inconsistencies movie makes movie stupid words example time rate concerning infected people zombified differs greatly sometimes takes seconds times takes hours zombies run others drag feet walk really slow even kungfu moves others hide stacks hay surprise people zombies even talk funniest moment course infamous zombie head fridge gag elevates midair attacks stupid man goes looking food funnily enough girlfriend gets throat torn headless counterpart lmaothe biggest disappointment though lack storylines involving people fact killed zombies never get see come back zombies fact ones see zombified ones pecked birds one girl gets legs bitten off that least expecting couple killed kitchen andor guy killed bridge come back zombies also amazing zombies take few bites move next victim laughable moment course zombie fetus pregnant woman infected lies bed hospital woman seems lot medical knowledge tries deliver baby  face pulled zombie head pushed womans stomach hand bursts proceeds rip rest face off timelessas usual characters perfect stereotypes genre megalomaniacal military officer pathetic useless squealing women scream get killed obvious characters get killed ie watch man chasing chicken guess movie really comedy many laughable scenes shed gets blown hand grenade obviously scene entire budget spent climatic scene man screams im thirsty thirsty blood costumes really bad  zombies reappear throughout course film wearing asianlike clothing may found bruce lee film watch blue s skirt girl motel wearing boyfriend bump infected manthe end film leaves open door usual apocalyptic storyline radio dj narrates throughout whole movie turns zombie warns listeners beginning end two survivors take helicopter hardly dawn dead material ask meregardless movie deliver many laughs gore minimal gore is unconvincing let alone unimaginative usual mix black blood thick green goo oozing weeping sores zombie makeup consisting green moss zombi  makes good rental sleepover party night beer popcorn that horror fans stay away ,movie recently released dvd
